```

`ts-server` is the standalone version.

>
> ```bash
> ./build/ts-server -config config/openGemini.singlenode.conf
> ```
>
> If you want to start it in the background, you can use the following command.
>
> ```bash
> nohup ./build/ts-server -config config/openGemini.singlenode.conf > server_extra.log 2>&1 &
> ```
