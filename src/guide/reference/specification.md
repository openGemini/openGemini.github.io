In order to help you use openGemini better, we recommend the following virtual machine specification, mainly based on the number of time-series cardinality.
|virtual machine specification|time series|
|---|---------|
|4U8G|300,0000|
|4U16G|600,0000|
|8U16G|600,0000|
|8U32G|1250,0000|
|16U32G|1250,0000|
|16U64G|2500,0000|
|32U64G|2500,0000|
|32U128G|5000,0000|
|64U256G|10000,0000|
  
## time series

### What is time series data？
Time series data refered to as time-stamped data. is a sequence of data points order by time.
### What is time series？
A time series is a modeling of time series data, and the time series data refers to a collection of a series of data points generated by the same data source.  
**For example**  
```sql
mst,host=“192.168.0.1” cpu=0.82 1566000000
mst,host=“192.168.0.1” cpu=0.62 1567000000
mst,host=“192.168.0.1” cpu=0.32 1568000000  
```
The data source here refers to the machine whose host is "192.168.0.1".  
openGemini supports InfluxDB's Line Protocol. The time series consists of two parts (time series Key and time series Value). The time series Key includes tags (data attributes), which uniquely identifies a time series. In other words, each combination of tags It's just a time series.
**For example:**  
There are 6 rows data, the table is mst, and the Tags are ```region``` and ```host```  
```sql
mst,region="Shanghai",host=“192.168.0.1” cpu=0.82 1566000000
mst,region="Guangdong",host=“192.168.0.1” cpu=0.72 1566000000
mst,region="Shanghai",host=“192.168.0.2” cpu=0.82 1566000000
mst,region="Shanghai",host=“192.168.0.2” cpu=0.72 15676000000
mst,region="Guangdong",host=“192.168.0.3” cpu=0.72 1566000000
mst,region="Guangdong",host=“192.168.0.2” cpu=0.72 1566000000
```
There are 5 time series, as following:
```sql
region="Shanghai",host=“192.168.0.1”
region="Shanghai",host=“192.168.0.2”
region="Guangdong",host=“192.168.0.1”
region="Guangdong",host=“192.168.0.2”
region="Guangdong",host=“192.168.0.3”
```
