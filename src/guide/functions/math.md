This chapter mainly introduces the following functions:

| math functions | descriptions |
| --- | --- | 
| ABS() | Returns the absolute value of the field value. |
| ACOS() | Returns the arccosine (in radians) of the field value. Field values must be between -1 and 1 | 
| ASIN() | Returns the arcsine (in radians) of the field value. Field values must be between -1 and 1 |
| COS() | Returns the cosine of the field value |
| SIN()	| Returns the sine of the field value |
| TAN()	| Returns the tangent of the field value |
| ATAN() |Returns the arctangent (in radians) of the field value. Field values must be between -1 and 1|
|ATAN2() | Returns the the arctangent of y/x in radians |
| CEIL() | Returns the subsequent value rounded up to the nearest integer |
|EXP() | Returns the exponential of the field value |
| FLOOR()| Returns the subsequent value rounded down to the nearest integer |
| LN() | Returns the natural logarithm of the field value |
| LOG()	| Returns the logarithm of the field value with base ```b``` |
| LOG2()| Returns the logarithm of the field value to the base ```2``` |
| LOG10()| Returns the logarithm of the field value to the base ```10``` |
| POW() | Returns the field value to the power of ```x``` |
| ROUND()| Returns the subsequent value rounded to the nearest integer |
| SQRT() | Returns the square root of field value |
