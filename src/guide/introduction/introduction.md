## Introduction

OpenGemini is a global open-source cloud-native distributed time series database designed and developed by [HUAWEI CLOUD Database Innovation Lab ](https://www.huaweicloud.com/lab/clouddb/home.html). It provides standalone and distributed versions with excellent read and write performance and efficient data analysis capabilities. Supports mainstream development languages and multi-form deployment (such as cloud, Docker, and physical machine), integrates storage and analysis, and is easy to expand. It is dedicated to efficiently storing and analyzing massive time series data in IoT and O&M monitoring scenarios to further reduce enterprise operation and O&M costs and improve product quality and production efficiency.

## Five Core Features

### High Performance

Store and query data quickly and efficiently with automatic partitioning, LSM-based storage techniques, and better data process engineering

### High Scalability

Adopting MPP architecture, support distributed cluster deployment and can be flexibly expanded as business grows to meet higher load requirements. 

### High Cardinality

A new high cardinality storage engine solves problems such as excessive index memory usage and low read and write performance

### Integrated storage and analysis

The built-in AI data analysis platform provides real-time anomaly detection capabilities for time series data and implements closed-loop management from data storage to data analysis.

### Observability

All observability-data such as metrics, logs, and traces are stored in openGemini, simplifying the storage and analysis

### Low Storage Costs

Column-based storage is used to provide efficient data compression algorithm. With the same data volume, the storage cost is only 1/20 of that of relational databases and 1/10 of that of NoSQL.
